Welcome to Dad Code - Where Python Meets Parenting
Greetings and salutations from the land of half-finished web apps and dad jokes! 🎩

About:
So, you've stumbled upon my Django Python-based web app, currently in the womb of progress. 🚀 Here's a little backstory to tickle your curiosity:

Back in the days when I first dipped my toes into Python, I discovered that the best way to wrap my head around it was by diving into projects. That's when the seeds of this web app were sown. I gathered all the quirks, games, and tech tidbits I encountered during my Python journey and tossed them into a digital cauldron, stirring up what you see here.

Aesthetic Disclaimer:
Now, let's address the elephant in the room... or rather, the retro vibes of this app. Picture it: a time capsule from 1997, complete with pixelated graphics and a UI only a mother (or a new dad) could love. Yes, I confess, my front-end skills are a bit vintage. But hey, it's all part of the charm! 🕹️

The Dad Joke Saga:
When I proudly presented my creation to my better half, expecting applause, what did I get? A quizzical look followed by, "Is this a joke?" 🤔 And in that moment, "Dad Code" was christened into existence. Because let's face it, between diapers and debugging, who has time to master HTML like it's the Matrix?

So here we are, in the realm of "Dad Code," where Python meets parenting, and the code is as dad-worthy as the jokes. Enjoy your stay, and remember, Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V are your friends. 😉
